<!--
Note for contributors: The README.md file that includes the list of papers is generated
automatically with a python script.

* If you want to update the list of papers, make the change on the papers.yml file.
* If you want to update the README file, make the change in the README.md.template file.

In both cases, run this to generate the new README.md file:

  $ pip install requests pyyaml
  $ ./gen_readme.py > README.md
