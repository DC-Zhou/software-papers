<br/>

This list was inspired by (and draws from) the [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/) project and
the [Ideas That Created the Future](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ideas-created-future) book by Harry R. Lewis.
I also found [the morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) blog to be an extremly useful resource.

## Selection criteria

1. The list should stay short. Let's say no more than 30 papers.
   - The idea is not to include every interesting paper that I come across but rather to keep a representative list that's possible to read from start to finish with a similar level of effort as reading a technical book from cover to cover.
   - I tried to include one paper per each major topic and author. Other related papers that I found interesting or noteworthy are included in sublists.
2. The papers shouldn't be too long. For the same reasons as the previous item, I try to avoid papers longer than 20 or 30 pages.
3. They should be self-contained and readable enough to be approachable by the casual technical reader.
4. They should be freely available online.
5. Although historical relevance was taken into account, I omitted seminal papers in the cases where I found them hard to approach, when the main subject of the paper wasn't the thing that made them influential, etc.
   - That being said, where possible I preferred the original paper on each subject over modern updates or summary papers.
6. I tended to prefer topics that I can relate to my professional practice, typically papers originated in the industry
or about innovations that later saw wide adoption. Likewise I tended to skip more theoretical papers, those focused on mathematical foundations for Computer Science,
on electronic aspects of hardware, etc.


Disclaimer: I'm not a frequent paper reader, so I made this list as a sort of roadmap for myself. I haven't read all of the papers in the list yet; as I do, I may find than some don't meet the described criteria after all and remove them, or decide to add new ones.

And, yes, this repository is a way to procrastinate on the actual reading after I finished making the list.
